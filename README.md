# Homework 6 - Weather Dashboard - Michael Mallon

## What I did
In homework 6, I used the OpenWeather Map API to retrieve weather related date for a given city. I also utalixed my knowlege in HTML and CSS development to write the front end for this application. The cities searched are saved in local storage and displayed on-screen in buttons. UV index is formatted based on how high it is. Weather pictures are retrieved based on the icon object that is retrieved when the API is given a city.

<br>

### Motivation:
I knew from the start that server-side APIs were important and this homework assignment was so-far the most interesting on for me. I am really excited for Project 1 where we will be using a server-side API of our choice. I know that this is good practice and will help me in the future

<br>

### Problems I solved:
    * Used moment() to display the current date
    * Used local storage to save and update an array
    * Manipulated array so elements in array are displayed as buttons
    * Used a server-side API to retrieve information about the weather
    * Manipulated API URL to get the information I wanted
